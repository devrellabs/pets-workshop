          Nestled in the heart of Seattle, Tailspin Shelter is a warm, welcoming haven for dogs of all breeds and backgrounds. Founded in 2015 by Kayo Miwa, Zava's Chief Executive Officer, this shelter began as a heartfelt extension of Zava's social impact initiatives. Kayo, a biomedical engineer with a lifelong passion for dogs, envisioned a place where every dog could find not just shelter, but a path to a loving, forever home. What started as a personal mission has blossomed into a community cornerstone, with many Zava employees volunteering their time and expertise to support our cause.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-300">
          For Kayo and the Zava team, Tailspin Shelter represents more than just corporate philanthropy—it's a way to give back to the community in a manner that's personally meaningful and aligned with their values. Just as Zava works to improve lives through innovative smart fiber technology, Tailspin Shelter transforms the lives of dogs and the families who adopt them. Our mission is to give every dog a second chance at a happy, healthy life, whether through finding forever homes, providing medical care, or offering behavioral training. Inspired by Seattle's vibrant and compassionate community, we've grown from a small foster network into a full-service shelter and adoption center.

          The name "Tailspin" reflects both the whirlwind of emotions dogs often experience when they first arrive — and the joyful, spinning tails we see when they find their perfect match. For us, a "tailspin" is a reminder of the transformations we witness daily: from uncertainty and fear to trust, love, and boundless energy. It's this journey that fuels our work and reminds us why we do what we do. Every wagging tail is a testament to resilience and hope, and a reflection of the compassionate spirit that drives both Tailspin Shelter and Zava's commitment to making a positive impact in the world.
